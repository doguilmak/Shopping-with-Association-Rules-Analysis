<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>In this project, a recommendation model was developed with <i>Association rule analysis</i> based on the products preferred by the customers (random). Some inferences were obtained from the people who shopped among 9 different products representing the shopping cart of different people. The aim is to obtain and interpret the links between people's preferred products. Association rule extraction, which can provide a very efficient effect for markets.</p>

<h2>Data Set Information:</h2>

<p>The dataset has no real-world equivalent. It is completely randomly generated. Therefore, it will be of great benefit to going through the real data set in order to make a real recommendation. If you have the appropriate data set, you can go over it (hope you show it to me). Dataset is created by myself. It has <i>9 columns</i> and <i>2000</i> rows with the header. Each column represents different products. A value of <i>0</i> indicates that the product was not received by the customer, and a value of <i>1</i> indicates that the product was received by the customer.</p>
